    [title: "DokiDocs Documentation"]
    
    [heading: "Introduction"]
    <p>DokiDocs is a lightweight documentation framework that converts simple markup tags into styled HTML components. This page serves as both documentation and a live demo of all available features.</p>
    
    [heading: "Basic Text Elements"]
    
    [subheading: "Headings"]
    <p>Use title, heading, and subheading tags to structure your content:</p>
    
    [title: "This is a Title"]
    [heading: "This is a Heading"]
    [subheading: "This is a Subheading"]
    
    [subheading: "Paragraphs and Text Formatting"]
    <p>You can use regular HTML paragraphs or DokiDocs inline elements within your content. For example, you can include [code: "inline code"] snippets and [link: "clickable links" https://example.com] directly in your text.</p>
    
    [heading: "Code Examples"]
    
    [subheading: "Inline Code"]
    <p>Use the code tag for short code snippets: [code: "const variable = 'value'"]</p>
    
    [subheading: "Code Blocks"]
    <p>For larger code examples, use codeblock with optional language specification:</p>
    
    [codeblock javascript]
    function calculateSum(a, b) {
        // This is a comment
        const result = a + b;
        console.log("The sum is: " + result);
        return result;
    }
    [/codeblock]
    
    [codeblock html]
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is an HTML example</p>
    </div>
    [/codeblock]
    
    [heading: "Lists"]
    
    [subheading: "Unordered Lists"]
    <p>Create bulleted lists using various markers:</p>
    
    [list]
    - Dash bullet item

    [list]
    • Circular bullet item
    • Second circular item
    • Final circular item
    [/list]
    
    [list]

    [/list]

    [/list]
    
    [heading: "Tables"]
